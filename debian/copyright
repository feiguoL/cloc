 # =head1 CREDITS
 #
 # Versions through 0.59 (and much of this documentation) were written by:
 #
 # Mark-Jason Dominus, mjd-perl-diff@plover.com
 #
 # This version borrows some documentation and routine names from
 # Mark-Jason's, but Diff.pm's code was completely replaced.
 #
 # This code was adapted from the Smalltalk code of Mario Wolczko
 # <mario@wolczko.com>, which is available at
 # ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Smalltalk/MANCHESTER/manchester/4.0/diff.st
 #
 # C<sdiff> and C<traverse_balanced> were written by Mike Schilli
 # <m@perlmeister.com>.
 #
 # The algorithm is that described in
 # I<A Fast Algorithm for Computing Longest Common Subsequences>,
 # CACM, vol.20, no.5, pp.350-353, May 1977, with a few
 # minor improvements to improve the speed.
 #
 # Much work was done by Ned Konz (perl@bike-nomad.com).
 #
 # The OO interface and some other changes are by Tye McQueen.
